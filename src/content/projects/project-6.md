# Recipe Finder

## Overview
A user-friendly application that helps users discover recipes based on available ingredients, dietary preferences, and cuisine types. The app aims to simplify meal planning and reduce food waste.

## Features
- Search by available ingredients
- Filter by dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
- Browse recipes by cuisine type
- Save favorite recipes
- Create shopping lists
- Meal planning calendar
- Nutritional information display

## Technical Details

### Frontend
Built with React for a responsive and interactive user interface. CSS Grid is used for the layout, providing a visually appealing and responsive design that works well on all devices.

### API Integration
Integrates with a comprehensive recipe API that provides access to thousands of recipes with detailed information, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional data.

### Data Persistence
LocalStorage is used to save user preferences, favorite recipes, and shopping lists, allowing for a personalized experience without requiring user accounts.

## Development Challenges
Creating an intuitive search algorithm that could match available ingredients to recipes while accounting for substitutions and optional ingredients required careful consideration of user experience and data processing.

## Future Improvements
- User accounts for cross-device synchronization
- Recipe recommendation engine based on past preferences
- Social sharing features
- Integration with grocery delivery services
