## Technical Details

### Frontend
Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive interface. Redux manages the application state, providing a predictable state container.

### Backend
Firebase provides real-time database functionality, authentication, and hosting. This enables instant updates across all connected devices and secure user data management.

### State Management
Redux architecture with middleware for handling asynchronous operations ensures a consistent and maintainable codebase.

## Development Challenges
Implementing the drag-and-drop functionality across different devices while maintaining performance was challenging. This was addressed by optimizing the rendering process and implementing virtualized lists for large task collections.
