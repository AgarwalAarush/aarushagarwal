# Jarvis

## Overview
An innovative personal AI assistant that bridges the gap between human speech and digital automation. Jarvis combines cutting-edge voice recognition technology with intelligent natural language processing to create a seamless, conversational interface for controlling your digital environment. The system features both a powerful Python backend and an intuitive iOS frontend, making it accessible across multiple platforms.

## Features
- Real-time voice recognition with wake word detection ("Jarvis")
- Multi-platform support - Python backend with iOS/macOS frontend
- Advanced speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper models
- Multiple TTS engines - Cartesia and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech
- Intelligent command parsing with LLM-powered intent recognition
- System automation - volume control, brightness adjustment, application management
- Web integration - Google Search, YouTube Search, Spotify integration
- Memory and context management for personalized interactions
- Image generation capabilities through AI integration
- File system operations and terminal command execution
- Conversational AI chatbot with real-time internet information
- Cross-platform compatibility with native Swift UI

## Technical Details

### Voice Processing Architecture
Implemented sophisticated audio processing pipeline using Whisper for speech recognition with configurable model sizes (tiny to large). The system features intelligent voice activity detection, RMS-based silence detection, and keyword spotting for hands-free activation. Audio processing handles real-time streaming with optimized buffer management and noise filtering.

### Natural Language Understanding
Developed an advanced abstraction layer that categorizes user intents into actionable commands including general queries, system controls, application management, media playback, content creation, and web searches. The system uses LLM integration for context-aware responses and maintains conversation memory for personalized interactions.

### Cross-Platform Integration
Built with a modular architecture featuring a Python backend for heavy computational tasks and a native Swift frontend for iOS/macOS integration. The backend handles voice processing, AI inference, and system automation, while the frontend provides an intuitive chat interface with markdown support and real-time message handling.

### System Automation Engine
Created comprehensive automation capabilities including macOS system controls (volume, brightness), application lifecycle management (open/close), web browser automation, and terminal command execution. The system safely handles privileged operations while maintaining security boundaries.

## Development Challenges
Implementing reliable voice activity detection that works across various acoustic environments and microphone qualities required extensive audio processing optimization. Balancing response latency with accuracy in voice recognition, while maintaining context awareness across conversations, presented significant architectural challenges. Creating seamless integration between Python backend services and Swift frontend components required careful API design and efficient inter-process communication.
