## Overview
An innovative application leveraging computer vision technology to monitor and improve eye health during extended screen usage. AEye Health uses machine learning algorithms to analyze blink frequency and patterns, providing personalized recommendations to reduce digital eye strain and promote healthier screen habits.

## Features
- Real-time blink detection and analysis
- Personalized calibration based on user data
- Customized reminders for insufficient blinking
- Eye strain prevention recommendations
- Screen time monitoring and analytics
- User-friendly modern interface
- Personalized eye health reports
- Rest interval suggestions

## Technical Details

### Computer Vision Implementation
Utilized OpenCV library with Haar cascades and dlib to detect facial features and precisely track eye movements. The system analyzes blink patterns in real-time, creating a baseline for each user and identifying potentially harmful behaviors.

### Machine Learning Model
Developed algorithms that learn from user data to establish personalized baselines for blink frequency and duration. The model adapts to individual users, improving accuracy over time and providing increasingly tailored recommendations.

### User Interface
Designed a clean, intuitive interface that presents eye health data in an accessible format while minimizing additional eye strain. The UI incorporates modern design principles and clear visual indicators for user guidance.

## Development Challenges
Creating accurate blink detection algorithms that work reliably across different lighting conditions, camera qualities, and user positions required extensive testing and refinement. Balancing notification frequency to be helpful without becoming intrusive was another significant challenge.

## Impact
- Helps prevent Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) and related eye strain issues
- Promotes healthier screen habits through gentle reminders
- Increases awareness of digital eye health
- Provides preventative care for computer users of all ages

## Future Improvements
- Integration with workplace wellness programs
- Expanded analytics for long-term eye health trends
- Mobile application development
- Integration with other health monitoring systems
- Support for multiple users with profile switching
- Expanded dataset for more accurate machine learning models
