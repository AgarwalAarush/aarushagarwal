## Overview
A comprehensive test scheduling platform designed to solve the problem of uneven test distribution throughout the academic calendar. The application helps students manage their study time more effectively while enabling teachers to schedule assessments in a more balanced and efficient manner.

## Features
- Optimization algorithm for uniform test distribution
- Calendar view of upcoming tests and assessments
- Teacher dashboard for scheduling tests
- Student dashboard for viewing test schedule
- Real-time updates on schedule changes
- Analytics for identifying peak testing periods
- Automated notification system for upcoming tests
- School-wide assessment calendar

## Technical Details
### Frontend
Built with React to provide a responsive and intuitive interface for both students and teachers. The design prioritizes clarity and ease of use, making test scheduling and viewing straightforward for all users.

### Backend Infrastructure
Firebase powers the backend, providing real-time database capabilities and authentication services. The optimization of server calls reduced overhead by 40%, significantly improving performance.

### Optimization Algorithm
A custom-built algorithm analyzes existing test schedules and recommends optimal testing dates to ensure even distribution throughout the month, preventing clustering of assessments that can overwhelm students.

## Development Challenges
Creating an algorithm that could balance the needs of multiple teachers while considering subject-specific requirements and school calendar constraints required extensive testing and refinement to achieve optimal results.

## Impact
- Gained overwhelming support from district administration
- Adopted by more than 50 teachers in Mountain View, California
- Improved student test preparation and reduced stress
- Enhanced communication between teachers regarding assessment scheduling

## Future Improvements
- Integration with school management systems
- Advanced analytics for student performance correlation
- Personalized study recommendation engine
- Mobile application for on-the-go schedule access
- District-wide implementation options
